        Cats are one of, if not the most, popular pet in the world.

        There are over 500 million domestic cats in the world.

        Cats and humans have been associated for nearly 10000 years.

        Cats conserve energy by sleeping for an average of 13 to14 hours a day.

        Cats have flexible bodies and teeth adapted for hunting small animals such as mice and rats.

         A group of cats is called a clowder, a male cat is called a tom, a female cat is called a molly or queen while young cats are called kittens.

    <p>
        Domestic cats usually weigh around 4 kilograms (8 lb 13 oz) to 5 kilograms (11 lb 0 oz).

        The heaviest domestic cat on record is 21.297 kilograms (46 lb 15.2 oz).

        Cats can be lethal hunters and very sneaky, when they walk their back paws step almost exactly in the same place as the front paws did beforehand, this keeps noise to a minimum and limits visible tracks.

    Cats have powerful night vision, allowing them to see at light levels six times lower than what a human needs in order to see.
